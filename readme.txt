RockMUD v0.2

History:
RockMUD was spawned out of many years of actual Diku Mudding, a love of JavaScript, and
late-night boredom. 

Goals:
The goals are lofty, and at this point theres barely a need to list them as im the sole
developer. But here we go:

* provide a Diku-like MUD experience from within the browser using NodeJS
* seperate out the CSS, and optimize for themeing. Typography is a feature.
* all core files are JavaScript or JSON.
* Work on devising a possible MVC architecture to help outside builders
* engine should have an emphasis on adventure!

Note: i dont feel like using a node MVC framework for this
