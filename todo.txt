RockMUD work before .2 (in a few days):

- Combat Rounds, 
- All 'standard' mud channels,
- clean up function parameters, 
- save a created character (i broke this tonight when refactoring), hash passwords
- save command.
- Better parsing of commands, regexp characters crash mud (passing in a  ? for example)
- Working on reading and adjuting areas/vnums for movement
