RockMUD work before 0.2.0 (in a few days):

- Combat Rounds, 
- All 'standard' mud channels,
- clean up function parameters, 
- class stats on creation
- all character skills (skills.js)
- one script per character class for skills (fighter.js, cleric.js)
- save command.
- Better parsing of commands (continuing)
- Working on reading and adjuting areas/vnums for movement / ticks (30% or so)  
- use socket.io to manage all logged in users rather than players[]?

Before 0.2.5
- Hunger / Thirst
- Items in the room
- Add to inventory

General Notes:
Player object is appended to the socket.io socket itself, s.player, therefore any player can be obtained with
io.sockets.socket(s.id)

Ticks should work on different intervals

For now the player 'saved' attribute is also adjusted upon login

Should be no notion of game state client side
